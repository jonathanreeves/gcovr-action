Generate code coverage reports for a C++ project on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) using [gcovr](https://gcovr.com/en/stable/).

## Usage

For more information, see [action.yml](./action.yml) and [GitHub Actions guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions).

### Inputs

| --- | --- | --- |
| `root` | Path | The root directory of your source files. Defaults to current directory. File names are reported relative to this root. |
| `gcov-executable` | Executable name with optional arguments | Use a particular gcov executable. Must match the compiler you are using, e.g. `llvm-cov gcov` for [LLVM](https://llvm.org/). See [this](https://docs.coveralls.io/api-introduction). |
| `exclude` | Regular expression | Exclude source files that match this filter. |
| `fail-under-line` | 0 - 100 | Fail if the total line coverage is less than this value. |
| `coveralls-out` | Path | Output file of generated Coveralls API coverage report. |
| `coveralls-send` | `true` or `false` | Send Coveralls API coverage report to it's endpoint (default: `false`). |
| `github-token` | Token | GitHub token of this project. Must be set to `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`. Required for sending Coveralls API coverage report successfully. |

### Examples

```yaml
name: test
on:
  push:
jobs:
  test-coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check out this repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3.2.0

      - name: Build and test this project
        run: |
          cmake . -B build
          cmake --build build
          ctest --test-dir build

      - name: Generate a code coverage report
        uses: threeal/gcovr-action@latest
```

> Note: You can replace `@latest` with any version you like.

#### Using LLVM

```yaml
- name: Build and test this project
  run: |
    cmake . -B build -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
    cmake --build build
    ctest --test-dir build

- name: Generate a code coverage report
  uses: threeal/gcovr-action@latest
  with:
    gcov-executable: llvm-cov gcov
```

#### Send to Coveralls

```yaml
- name: Generate and send a code coverage report to Coveralls
  uses: threeal/gcovr-action@latest
  with:
    coveralls-send: true
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
